# RecommenderSystem
Recommender System using Machine Learning

In this project, we will focus on providing a basic recommendation system by suggesting items that are most similar to a particular item,
in this case, movies. 
It tells you what movies/items are most similar to your movie choice based on previously liked movies by you and also
keeps a weigthed average of different movies. 
Weighted average means those movies are considered which had many votes rather than those  movies which hardly had one or two votes.
